1. Click on [ LAUNCH GPU ]. A new browser tab will launch.&nbsp; 
2. In the new tab, click Runtime --> Run All&nbsp; 
3. On the pop-up warning, click "run anyway."&nbsp; 
4. Return to this browser tab.&nbsp;

Note 1: *This is a free service that runs using Google Colab's spare computing resources, and will not run quickly or sometimes you need to retry a few times when no GPUs are available.*&nbsp; &nbsp; 

Note 2: *There are some bugs in the code of Pollinations which result in it becoming desynchronized with Colab. Sometimes one has to go to the Colab tab and click "Runtime -> Restart and Run All" and retry.*

Note 3: *Data is stored on the Interplanetary Filesystem. No information about the user is saved.*
