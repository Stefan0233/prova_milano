### Instructions

1. Visit the URL [pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) (preferably in Google Chrome).
2. Click on `NodeID -> [ LAUNCH ]`. A new browser tab will launch.
3. In the new tab, click `Runtime --> Run All`.
4. On the pop-up warning, click "run anyway."
5. Return to this browser tab.
6. The Inputs text fields will now become editable. In the text_input box, type a description for the AI to generate images from. Get creative!
7. Select `[ SUBMIT ]`. Note: This may take several minutes before you start to see the images being generated.
8. When the rendering is complete, the .mp4 video will be generated. Right-click to save the video file to disc.
9. Once you have rendered the first sentence, it should be much faster to generate new ones. 

 *Note: This is run using Google Colab's spare computing resources, and will not run quickly or sometimes you need to retry a few times when no GPUs are available.*

 *Note 2: There are some bugs in the code of Pollinations which result in it becoming desyncronized with Colab. Sometimes one has to go to the Colab tab and click "Runtime -> Restart and Run All" and continue from step 5.*
 
 *Note 3: A bot is optionally posting finished Pollinations to Twitter and a few other social networks. Data is stored on the Interplanetary Filesystem. No information about the user is saved. Use the checkbox to deactivate posting.*
